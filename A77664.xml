         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though it bee a matter worth con≈øideration; yet ≈øome doe not con≈øider it at all: becau≈øe they ≈øee ≈øo many dye, they make the le≈ø≈øe reckoning of it: till death knocke at their owne doores, they never regard it: they mu≈øt needs dye them≈øelves, before they can bee brought to con≈øider of death: they care not who ≈øinke, ≈øo they ≈øwimme; nor how many die, ≈øo they may live: yea this is greatly to be lamented, that ≈øome doe regard the death of a Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, no more then they regard the death of a dog.

                  <p>Others doe con≈øider it, but yet ami≈ø≈øe; either fondly, or froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Fondly, through naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ari≈øing from kindred, affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or familiaritie. If a ≈øtranger die, it nothing moves them: but if one of their owne friends dye, they ≈øigh and ≈øob, they howle and lament.

For as <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> found ≈øweet honey in the carca≈ø≈øe of a dead Lion; ≈øo wee may finde ≈øome ≈øweet in≈øtructions in the dead corps of every righteous man: yea the more righteous that they are which doe die, the more ≈øhould their death be con≈øidered, becau≈øe it may yeeld greater ≈øtore of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction unto us.

But they mu≈øt bee in≈øtructed in this point by wi≈øe <hi>Salomon,</hi> who ≈øaith: <hi>that no man knoweth love or hatred of all that is before him. All things come alike to all: and the ≈øame condition is to the

Eli</hi> was a Prie≈øt, and a good man; yet brake his necke by falling backward from his ≈øeat. <hi>Ionathan</hi> was a ≈øworne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto <hi>David,</hi> a godly and faithfull friend; yet was he ≈ølaine in battell by the hands of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øtims. That Prophet of God which came out of <hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> to ≈øpeak with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and the altars which he had built for ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, was no doubt an holy man; yet was hee killed in the way by a Lion? <hi>Io≈øiah</hi> was a good King, like unto him there was no King before him, neither after him ro≈øe any like him: yet was

The righteous need not to imitate the ungodly practice of <hi>Herod,</hi> who being ready to die, and thinking that his death would be a great joy to many, ≈øhut up in pri≈øon ≈øome Noblemen in every town; and required his ≈øi≈øter <hi>Salome,</hi> and her husband <hi>Alexa,</hi> that ≈øo ≈øoone as he was dead, they ≈øhould kill tho≈øe Noblemen, and then all <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> would lament his death. The Lord him≈øelfe doth often make the death of the righteous to bee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119685:20"/> lamented, by ≈øending of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgements immediately after their death. When <hi>Noah</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Arke, the world is drowned with the floud; when <hi>Lot</hi> departs out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> it is burnt with fire.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In this re≈øpect al≈øo the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have no cau≈øe to feare death, but rather to de≈øire it; for what is it but an ending of ≈øome troubles and a preventing of others?

And therefore hee feares death as much as a malefactor feareth a Serjeant that commeth to carry him to pri≈øon, where he is like to abide till the day of execution. That is true in them which the Divell ≈øaid, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that ever a man hath, will he give for his life.</hi> And as the Gibeonites were content rather to be bondmen, &amp; hewers of wood, and drawers of water, then to bee killed by the I≈øraelites as other nations were: So they had rather indure any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119685:21"/> kinde of mi≈øerie, then to die as others doe, becau≈øe they feare a wor≈øe e≈øtate after death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mu≈øt bee pulled from the earth with as great violence, as <hi>Ioab</hi> was pulled from the hornes of the altar, unto which he had fled as to a place of refuge. But the godly knowing what an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie exchange they make by death, they de≈øire to die ≈øo ≈øoone as it plea≈øeth the Lord. Indeed none ought for the ending of pre≈øent calamities, or preventing of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mi≈øeries, to ≈øhorten their owne dayes, as <hi>Saul</hi> did by falling on his owne ≈øword; nor yet for the pre≈øent enjoying of eternall happine≈ø≈øe, procure their owne death; as <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> did, who

                  <p>And la≈øt of all for his patience and long ≈øuffering, I ≈øhall onely write this for any judicious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge, that notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my Satyricall writing, yet he was never moved therewith, but as I thought did affect me the better for expending my ≈øpare time in ≈øuch divine meditations, and did ≈øay that God had put into his heart to doe me good, which he hath done accordingly, for if

And although he was grievou≈øly pained with the ≈øtone in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of which he dyed, yet for my good he was willing to doe any thing which I thought would procure me profit, and never ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee impatient, as many would have beene, had they felt ≈øuch paine as he did.</p>
                  <p>What ≈øhall I ≈øay more? for in him all graces ≈øeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catinated

                  <p>Now it was not my happines to bee with him at the houre of his death, neither did I continue long in his pre≈øence during the time of his ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe I had given him ju≈øt cau≈øe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by ≈øome mi≈ødemeanours.

And upon Newyeares day la≈øt, perceiving his houre draw neere, ≈øealed his Will, and went quietly to bed, as to his grave, from

                  <p>And one thing I cannot but ob≈øerve, that when any came to vi≈øit him during tho≈øe foure daies, <hi>viz.</hi> from Saturday to Wedne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and demanded how he did, he would an≈øwer, <hi>Sick, as a pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in hope:</hi> which me thinks was a heavenly ≈øpeech, for hee knew his ≈øoule was impri≈øoned in a brittle hou≈øe of clay, out of which he hoped ≈øhe ≈øhould ≈øhortly bee delivered, and carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God into a heavenly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, to enjoy everla≈øting free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Ju≈øtice appeares in his other beque≈øts to his kindred and alliance. In that hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mo≈øt to them he did lea≈øt for in his life, ≈øo that there might be an equivolence among≈øt all, and

                  <p>Thirdly, Ju≈øtice appeares in his other beque≈øts, e≈øpecially to his poore ≈øervants and retainers, that he hath forgot none, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred all in a lumpe of 300. pound, to bee di≈øpo≈øed at ≈øuch times, in ≈øuch parcels, and to ≈øuch per≈øons as his Lady plea≈øeth, <hi>≈øome of them being ≈øuch as de≈øerved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> are his owne words in one clau≈øe of his will, where they are thus mentioned. And herein was a point of policy, to keepe them under ≈øubjection, in depending upon her favour. After them hee remembers me with 20. pound, on purpo≈øe to make me, as I ever thought my ≈øelfe to be in ≈øome

But letting ju≈øtice and mercy remaine with him in the actions of his life, behold mercy ≈øhall flouri≈øh after his death. And as ≈øhe is over all Gods workes, ≈øo ≈øhe hath preheminence over all Sir <hi>Iames</hi> his beque≈øts, in a more eminent manner. For hee hath not onely given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He hath in≈øtructed the ignorant, corrected the ≈øinner, comforted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119685:34"/> the heavie hearted, forgiven of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, borne with the weake, and prayed for all.

                  <p>Fir≈øt, that poor children ≈øhould be wel educated, and brought up in good learning, hee hath given one thou≈øand Markes for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and maintenance of a Free-Schoole in the towne of Barking in E≈ø≈øex.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to keep youth from beggery and theevery, which is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119685:34"/> begot by ≈øloath and idlene≈ø≈øe, the root of all evill, hee hath bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed two thou≈øand pounds for a ≈øtocke to keep ≈øuch at labour and worke in Bridewell, that they as others ≈øhould labour with their owne hands, and in the ≈øweat of their browes eate their bread, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God commanded <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> po≈øterity, and this ≈øtocke is to be ordered and di≈øpo≈øed by the advice and coun≈øell of the ≈øage≈øt and grave≈øt Senators of this City.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to enable young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners to goe on chearfully in their callings, in workes of good husbandry, he hath left thirteene hundred pounds to bee lent to poore freemen of the company of Ironmongers, 100. pound a

                  <p>Fourthly, for the reliefe of poor helple≈ø≈øe children in Chri≈øt ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall he hath given 500. pound To enlarge the ho≈øpitall of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in Southwark with more lodging for poore ≈øicke di≈øea≈øed per≈øons, he hath given 1500. li. And for a further reliefe of the poore, blinde, lame, di≈øea≈øed, and lunatique per≈øons in Bridewell, St. <hi>Bartholomewes,</hi> and Bethlehem Ho≈øpitalls, he hath given 300. li. <hi>viz.</hi> 100. li. to each.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, for redemption of poor Captives under Turki≈øh ≈ølavery, where they are inforced by cruell torments to for≈øake their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hath given one thou≈øand
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119685:35"/> pounds. And for the relea≈øe and reliefe of poore di≈øtre≈ø≈øed pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that lye in mi≈øerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by meanes of mercile≈ø≈øe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, in nine pri≈øons in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout London, he hath given one thou≈øand pounds. What ≈øhall I ≈øay more? I am amazed at ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny charitable beque≈øts of one man, for he hath not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Laity, but the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie al≈øo, not onely the valiant Souldiers, the Gentlemen of the Artillery Garden, with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds towards their ≈øtock, and one hundred markes for a dinner or ≈øupper, becau≈øe he was once cho≈øen a Colonell of this City: but poore hone≈øt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mini≈øters al≈øo, with 500. li.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119685:36"/> towards the ≈øupply of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities, not to exceed 5. li. nor le≈ø≈øe then 40. ≈øhillings a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he would nouri≈øh learning and religion, for he knew lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bee a maine prop to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold religion in its purity, and therefore not to bee de≈øpi≈øed, as now it is, for the infirmities of ≈øome few men. And not onely mankinde in generall, but ≈øuch things as conduce to his honour and livelihood, this judicious charitable Gentleman hath thought on in the compo≈øure of his Te≈øtament, fir≈øt to comfort and refre≈øh the poore de≈øtitute in cold weather, he hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fathers ≈øteps, and left 500. pounds for a further ≈øupply of a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119685:36"/> ≈øtocke of Coales, which his ≈øaid father Sir <hi>Thomas Cambel</hi> Knight, and ≈øometime Lord Maior of London began with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds: ≈øecondly, to make wayes pa≈ø≈øable, to abridge long journeyes, and to ea≈øe labour, he hath left 250. pounds for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new bridge over the Foord neere Wan≈øted in E≈ø≈øex: and la≈øt of al, that we as he ≈øhould delight to bee in the Church of God, which is the congregation of the faithfull, the hou≈øe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where with one heart wee ≈øhould heare God ≈øpeake unto us by his word, and wee unto him by humble confe≈ø≈øion, earne≈øt ≈øupplication, and hearty thank≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, hee hath given one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119685:37"/> pounds towards the repaire of the mother Church the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which evidently ≈øhowes he was a man that did approve all things in the wor≈øhip of God ≈øhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and in good order. And le≈øt he him≈øelfe ≈øhould forget any that were capable of charity, hee hath left the overplus of his e≈øtate (which by his computation will be ten thou≈øand pounds, if not impaired by bad debts, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe) in his Executors di≈øcretion to di≈øpo≈øe of in ≈øome ≈øuch piou and charitable worke or workes, thing or things, as they ≈øhall think fit, which I hope will bee to the glory of God, the reliefe of the poor, the honour of the decea≈øed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119685:37"/> and to the comfort and joy of the Executors them≈øelves. Yet I have not mentioned all his charitable Legacies, for I have not made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of 120. l. to 120. poor men in money or gownes, and 12. d. a piece for their dinner upon the day of his Funerall. 200. l. to poore beggars to avoid trouble on the ≈øame day. 200. l. to the poore of the Pari≈øhes of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Poore, and Saint <hi>Olaves</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry London, and of Barking in E≈ø≈øex. Be≈øides 100. l. to the pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhioners of the Pari≈øh of Saint <hi>Olaves</hi> Jewry, for their good will to erect his monument by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and his brothers Ma≈øter <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cambel,</hi> late Alderman of London. And being he was ≈øo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119685:38"/> carefull for his honour while hee lived I thought it part of my duty to take ≈øome labour for the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation therof now he is dead, which I could no better way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, then by publi≈øhing tho≈øe his unparalleled Legacies: for though that may bee more ≈øolid and durable, yet this my labour may be as profitable and u≈øefull for the ≈øtirring up of ≈øome chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mens heart to doe workes of this nature. For if they be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ju≈øt while they live, they will ≈øhew the fruits thereof at their death, becau≈øe ≈øuch men doe ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome any great worke of charity till their death, if they doe any then, as I have beene told by ≈øome; for every rich man is not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119685:38"/> as Sir <hi>Iames,</hi> becau≈øe hee brought Ju≈øtice and Mercy with him from his cradle, charactered on his name.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I cea≈øe to wonder that he hath left ≈øuch a paterne at his death, when his name which was given him pre≈øently after his birth demon≈øtrated the ≈øame, as appeares in the Acro≈øticke ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and Anagrams following, made by mee neare three yeares ≈øince, and pre≈øented.</p>

But I will write of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> as a Serpent: and to prove that hee had the properties and qualities that are in a Serpent, and ≈øo very well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thereunto, I will divide him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts: fir≈øt his <hi>head,</hi> ≈øecondly his <hi>skinne,</hi> and la≈øt of all his <hi>≈øting.</hi> Fir≈øt, that <hi>Laban</hi> had the head of a Serpent, <hi>viz.</hi> he was wi≈øe politique, and very crafty, is plaine. The Scripture te≈øtifies that the Serpent was more ≈øubtile then any bea≈øt of the field. And Chri≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth us to be wi≈øe as Serpents, both for the defence of our ≈øelves, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our enemies. The Serpents wi≈øedome con≈øi≈øts in foure things. Fir≈øt, in the Spring ≈øhe ca≈øts off her old skin, and puts on a new: ≈øecondly, ≈øhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends her head above all things: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øhe ≈øtops her eares at the voice of the charmer: and la≈øtly, ≈øhe alwayes carries poi≈øon in her mouth, which ≈øhee expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth before ≈øhe drinkes. The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ≈øerpentine wi≈øedome I pa≈ø≈øe by. But affirme, that politicall wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119685:56"/> for every man to bee provident. Fir≈øt, for his owne ≈øoules ≈øalvation: ≈øecondly, for his owne bodies health: and thirdly, for the welfare of his own family, is ≈øo far from reproofe, that it is worthy high commendation. And chiefly the fir≈øt. But how <hi>Laban</hi> was thus qualified, there's the quaere. For fir≈øt, it's plaine he was not ≈øo wi≈øe as he ≈øhould bee, hee did want that which is the true wi≈øedome, <hi>viz. fiduciall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God.</hi> Hee went a≈øtray out of the right way, according as his father <hi>Nahor</hi> before him had done and wor≈øhipped Images, the worke of mens hands, wood and ≈øtone. For when <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> had ≈øtolne ≈øome of tho≈øe Images, he did exclaime again≈øt <hi>Iacob,</hi> that hee had ≈øtolne his gods: ≈øo when be made a covenant of peace with <hi>Iacob,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with an oath, taking the god of <hi>Nahor</hi> to be his witne≈ø≈øe. So that its plaine he was an <hi>idolater,</hi> and therefore not wi≈øe for his ≈øoules ≈øalvation, for no Idolater ≈øhall enter into the kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119685:57"/>
                  <p>Secondly, for the welfare of his own body, there is no que≈øtion but that hee as all worldly minded men are, and all godly men ≈øhould, was carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve that, if he did not take too much care thereupon.</p>
                  <p>And la≈øt of all, for the provi≈øion of his owne family, he was very carefull, and he that is not ≈øo, is wor≈øe then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell, even wor≈øe then <hi>Laban,</hi> for he was very covetous, and that appeares throughout the ≈øtory: for when <hi>Iacob</hi> had told him his arrand, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee had purcha≈øed the birthright of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, that he had obtained the ble≈ø≈øing of his father, that hee was ≈øent to him by his father and mother for a wife, that he had ≈øeene a vi≈øion by the way; and having according to his own agreement performed ≈øeven yeares for <hi>Rachel,</hi> he out of a ba≈øe covetous de≈øire, becau≈øe hee would not lo≈øe the benefit of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ≈øervice, cheated him with blear-ey'd <hi>Lea,</hi> and made him ≈øerve 7. yeares more for <hi>Rachel;</hi> for he thought, if <hi>Iacob</hi> had obtained his love, he would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119685:57"/> have ≈øerved him no longer. Therefore finding that God ble≈ø≈øed him for <hi>Iacobs</hi> ≈øake, and as <hi>Iacob</hi> told him, ≈øaying, for the little that thou had≈øt before I came, is increa≈øed to a multitude, was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and therefore agreed with him upon a certaine bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of wages. But when hee ≈øaw that <hi>Iacob</hi> got too much that way, he abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him of that, and changed his wages ten times: like many covetous ma≈øters in the≈øe dayes, that for feare their ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ≈øhould thrive under them, grow proud, or fit for better ≈øervices, doe what they can, as wel in abridging them of that which is their ju≈øt due, as ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in tho≈øe things they may get without them, I meane without any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or great trouble to them, as a word of their mouth, a note of their hand, or in performing the will of the dead. But I have no cau≈øe to complain in this particular, for I doe humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, my Ma≈øter hath and doth more good for me then I de≈øerve. Yet I pre≈øume to touch tho≈øe Ma≈øters that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119685:58"/> care not for their owne credit or their ≈øervants good. Therefore leaving the politique head of <hi>Laban,</hi> I come to his skinne. The skin of a Serpent is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and gli≈øtering, and ≈øeemeth more amiable then hurtfull; and <hi>Laban</hi> as his name ≈øignifies <hi>White,</hi> the mo≈øt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full colour, ≈øo he ≈øeemed to bee a very faire dealing hone≈øt man, as by his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Iacob</hi> appeareth, in the≈øe words: <hi>What ha≈øt thou done? thou ha≈øt even ≈øtoln away my heart, and carried away my daughters as though they had beene taken captives with the ≈øword: wherefore did≈øt thou flie ≈øo ≈øecretly, and ≈øteale away from me, and did≈øt not tell me, that I might have ≈øent thee forth with mirth, and with ≈øongs, with Timbrell, and with Harpe: But thou ha≈øt not ≈øuffered mee to ki≈ø≈øe my ≈øonnes and my daughters.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119685:59"/> could divine how God would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe provide for them, and ≈øo ≈øeeme to be very ju≈øt, righteous, and con≈øciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them≈øelves. The la≈øt part of <hi>Laban</hi> is his <hi>≈øting,</hi> and that hath a poi≈øonous and venemous quality, and wounds deadly. Which was the envious heart of <hi>Laban</hi> his intents to hurt <hi>Iacob.</hi> But how ≈øhall I finde them? fir≈øt, in his face by his lookes <hi>Iacob</hi> perceived it well, for ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to his wives he ≈øaid, I perceive your fathers countenance is not towards me, as it was wont. Secondly, by his words, his envie appeared in this ≈øaying, <hi>I am able to doe thee hurt.</hi> As much as if hee ≈øhould have ≈øaid, I could finde in my heart to take to my ≈øelfe all the≈øe ≈øheep, and droves of cattell that are mine, and what can I not doe? yea, I am able to doe thee evill, <hi>viz.</hi> to kill thee my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is good, <hi>But.</hi> This <hi>But</hi> ≈øpoiled all: But God forewarned me. Thirdly, his malice appeared by his actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides his comming to him, and pur≈øuing him with his brethren, the altering of his wages, and other hard ≈øervices,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119685:59"/> which he put him unto; it was very con≈øpicuous, in requiring of <hi>Iacob</hi> tho≈øe things which were lo≈øt by ca≈øuality and mi≈øchance, as him≈øelfe te≈øtifieth. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were torne by bea≈øts, or ≈øtolne by theeves, by night, or by day, he was forced to make it good. Like many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters in the≈øe our dayes, that force their poore ≈øervants to pay for things that are broke, or lo≈øt by ca≈øuality, and their pretence is to make them more carefull, when it is plaine, it is to ≈øecure their owne goods, and keepe their ≈øervants the poorer, that they may detaine them the longer in ≈øubjection. But yet wilful negligence in ≈øervants ought to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed, el≈øe they will not care what ≈øpoil they make of their ma≈øters goods, ≈øo that by this hard dealing of <hi>Laban, Iacob</hi> told him to his face, that except God had beene with him, hee ≈øhould have beene ≈øent away empty, as many ≈øervants are by ≈øuch ma≈øters. And thus much I thought good to write, to prove <hi>Laban a Serpent.</hi> And now I ≈øhould ≈øhow how this Serpent came to be a ≈øtaffe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119685:60"/> ≈øupport to <hi>Iacob.</hi> But before I write any further, I will note the rea≈øons why <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaac</hi> ≈øhould ≈øend his ≈øonne, that he had made Lord of his brethren, ≈øo poorely to ≈øeeke him a wife: did he forget how his father ≈øent <hi>Eleazar</hi> of Dama≈øus, the Steward, and elde≈øt ≈øervant of his hou≈øe in great ≈øtate, with 10. Camels, richly laden, and ≈øervants to attend them, to his brother <hi>Nahor</hi> to provide him a wife? or was <hi>I≈øaac</hi> now at this time poorer then his father <hi>Abraham?</hi> for an≈øwer to the fir≈øt que≈øtion, it could not be that <hi>I≈øaac</hi> being a godly man, and ≈øo brought up from his youth, could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a matter of ≈øuch con≈øequence. To the ≈øecond, it's plaine that hee was not poorer then his father, but rather richer. For <hi>Abimeleck</hi> King of the Phili≈øtins ≈øaid unto him, <hi>Get thee from us, for thou are mightier then we a great deale.</hi> But the rea≈øons as I conceive why <hi>I≈øaac</hi> ≈øhould ≈øend his ≈øonne <hi>Iacob</hi> away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attendance, or other riches, but his ≈øtaffe onely, as him≈øelfe te≈øtifies, was, fir≈øt for ≈øecrefie, that he might not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119685:60"/> be prevented of his journey by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>E≈øau,</hi> who had before vowed his death: for if <hi>Iacob</hi> ≈øhould have taken any ≈øervants or trea≈øure, it would have beene declared to his brother, who, as I ≈øurmi≈øe, was Lord of the hou≈øe and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, while his father lived. But ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his father ≈øent him away thus poorely, to teach <hi>Iacob</hi> that hee ≈øhould not depend upon his fathers ≈øub≈øtance, but upon the ble≈ø≈øing of God on his owne endeavours, according to the≈øe words, and <hi>God al≈øufficient ble≈ø≈øe thee, and make thee to encrea≈øe, &amp;c.</hi> Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cleared the way, I will ≈øhow you <hi>Iacob</hi> walking with his ≈øtaffe. A man u≈øeth a ≈øtaffe for one of the≈øe ends, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ≈øupport him from falling, or el≈øe to defend him from dangers. An old man u≈øeth a ≈øtaffe to ≈øupport his weake body, and a young man he u≈øeth a ≈øtaffe to defend him≈øelfe, and offend his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. In the fir≈øt exception God made this Serpent <hi>Laban</hi> a ≈øtaffe to <hi>Iacob,</hi> for when he came to <hi>Laban,</hi> he was ≈øo poor and weake, that he was not of him≈øelfe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119685:61"/> able to ≈øub≈øi≈øt, as by his vow appeares, when he did at that time de≈øire no more then clothes to weare, and bread to eat: ≈øo that it ≈øeemes hee was not very well ≈øtor'd at that time either with money or provi≈øion, as he afterwards acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the≈øe words, That he came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Jordan with his ≈øtaffe onely: and in this exigent he was refre≈øhed and ≈øupported by <hi>Laban.</hi> Fir≈øt, according to his wi≈øh, <hi>viz.</hi> with convenient ≈øu≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for I reade nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and therefore judge that <hi>Laban</hi> kept a good hou≈øe for his owne family: ≈øecondly, with two wives, two maids, twelve ≈øonnes and one daughter. And la≈øt of all, with a multitude of riches; ≈øo that in this he acknowledged Gods great ble≈ø≈øing towards him, for whereas he came to <hi>Laban</hi> with no more then a ≈øtaff, now he is become into two bands. But was there not as good ≈øupporters as <hi>Laban?</hi> could not <hi>Iacob</hi> finde as good ma≈øters as he? yes certainly, for hee might have done as well, if not better, with ≈øome other. But it was his father
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119685:61"/> and mothers plea≈øure hee ≈øhould take a wife from among their brethren. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in obedience to their will he came to ≈øerve <hi>Laban.</hi> Thus have I briefly declared how <hi>Iacob</hi> was ≈øupported by a Serpent. But from hence I would have none to inferre, that becau≈øe he ≈øerves a <hi>Laban,</hi> therefore he mu≈øt have the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of <hi>Iacob;</hi> for it was by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and not by <hi>Labans</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe that <hi>Iacob</hi> became ≈øo rich: for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, as a Serpent,</hi> if he had found any of his ≈øervants idle, or carele≈ø≈øe, he would be ≈øure to ≈øting them.

                     <hi>E≈øau</hi> was hunting to get ≈øavoury meat, ≈øuch as his father loved; <hi>Rebecca</hi> that knew her husbands appetite, as well as <hi>E≈øau,</hi> and could blinde his judgement, as well as his ≈øight, daintily cheated him, becau≈øe ≈øhe loved <hi>Iacob,</hi> in whom ≈øhe ≈øaw the graces of Gods Spirit ≈øhined bright, and did beleeve, that hee was the Sonne of Promi≈øe, according as God told her at his birth, <hi>That the elder ≈øhould ≈øerve the younger;</hi> and as ≈øhe perceived by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and godly exerci≈øes in the cour≈øe of his life, therefore ≈øhe prepared ≈øavoury meat, ≈øuch as ≈øhe knew her husband lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and compelled <hi>Iacob</hi> her younger ≈øonne, to pre≈øent it to his father in the name of his brother, who very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of a cur≈øe, rather then a ble≈ø≈øing, did performe her will; for hee knew ≈øuch cunning plotting, and indirect meanes by hypocri≈øie, and di≈ø≈øimulation to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øh their de≈øignes, was both hatefull to men, and abhomin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It's plaine he did de≈øire with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> to have the ble≈ø≈øing that <hi>Iacob</hi> ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted him in, and ≈øought it with teares.</p>
                  <p>But ≈øeeing be could not obtaine that, he de≈øired one ble≈ø≈øing of his father: and ≈øo according to his reque≈øt enjoyed the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the earth, and dew of heaven from above, <hi>viz.</hi> he lived in a fertile and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countrey, hee did not want for any earthly ble≈ø≈øing, and was a man of great power and authority, for from his ≈øtocke came many famous Kings, as is before expre≈ø≈øed, ≈øo that as he hunted for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, he did enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>Now to make a conclu≈øion of the whole matter, I ≈øhould ≈øhow the love of <hi>Iacob</hi> toward <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> the fir≈øt borne of <hi>Rachel</hi> his fir≈øt love. But what ≈øhould bee the rea≈øon that <hi>Iacob</hi> fixed his love more on him then all his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119685:74"/> Was it becau≈øe he brought to their father their evill ≈øayings? No ≈øurely, for <hi>Iacob</hi> as a godly man did not delight to heare any ≈ølanderous reports, for he knew that tale-bearers and bu≈øie bodies in other folkes matters, doe ≈øet hou≈øes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths in divi≈øions. The Text ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the rea≈øon thus, becau≈øe he begot him in his old age, and that might very well be, for experience ≈øhowes, old folke love little children more then young doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there is a ≈øympathizing affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, as the proverbe is, An old man is twice a child. But the rea≈øon as I conceive, why <hi>Iacob</hi> loved <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> more then all his brethren, was, becau≈øe he ≈øaw in him a promptitude to the ≈øervice of God, and divine ≈øpeculation, more then in his brethren, and that he was of a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, innocent, and ≈øweet di≈øpo≈øition, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly; for though hee knew his brethren hated him, becau≈øe of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love towards him; yet hee loved them, and would bee telling them his dreames, for which they hated him ≈øo much the more, which in my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119685:74"/> opinion was very improvidently done; for we ought to avoid, and not to run headlong into danger, and this ra≈øh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øing with his enemies, almo≈øt co≈øt him his life: fir≈øt, by putting him into a pit, and then ≈øelling him to perpetuall ≈ølavery. Yet this is, and was ever for the mo≈øt part the practice of the mo≈øt zealous godly, to ≈øpeake or doe ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at which the worldly wi≈øe taking advantage of, bring them into great per≈øecution and trouble, as it was here. But what care they for ≈øuch affliction, if God ≈øee it good for them? And what cared <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> for his brethrens ≈øpleene, ≈øo <hi>his father noted his ≈øayings.</hi> Now if from hence I could learne according to <hi>Salomons</hi> rule, to traine and bring up my children in the feare of the Lord in their youth, that ≈øo they might not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it when they be old: to bend the twig while it is young, le≈øt when it is growne to a tree, it be pa≈øt my ≈øtrength to bow or governe, as <hi>E≈øau</hi> was for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> for <hi>Eli,</hi> &amp;c. then I ≈øhould thinke my ≈øelfe a happy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119685:75"/> man. And this is the principall rea≈øon why I ≈øpend all this labour in looking after a di≈øcreet and vertuous woman, to helpe mee as well in the education of the≈øe two Infants I have, as tho≈øe that it ≈øhall plea≈øe the Lord to ≈øend me by her, that ≈øo having for the duration of my ≈øervice lived as <hi>Iacob,</hi> I may likewi≈øe as hee become into two bands.</p>

The man that is inflamed with this love, doth really fulfill the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ≈øecond Table in the morall Law; he loves his neighbour as him≈øelfe, this is a true charitable man; he hath di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed abroad and given to the poore, hee doth much good in the world, he relieves the needy, helpes the oppre≈ø≈øed, feeds the hungry, in≈øtructs the ignorant, comforts the comfortle≈ø≈øe, &amp;c. he layes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe here a good foundation by good workes, and ≈øhall at the la≈øt receive the reward of his labour, if he faint not.

To let the humane and civill love runne out as men are plea≈øed to convey it forth from the fountaine of their heart, I will onely fix my meditations upon this naturall love, and of that I will not write any thing of the love of parents to their children, or brother to brother, &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know their love may bee very great.

This breeds a con≈øumption in his pur≈øe, rottenne≈ø≈øe in his bones, and a blot in his good name. But if this love bee in the lawfull way of marriage, as this kinde is ≈øeldome to that effect, then if the lover doth make his choice onely for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the body, without any re≈øpect to the qualities of the minde, hee may finde one that may plea≈øe his eye, but commonly ≈øhe proves a wanton <hi>Hellen</hi> or a trayterous <hi>Dallila,</hi> one that will con≈øume his wealth, and worke his de≈øtruction: or el≈øe ≈øuch a one that will make him a ≈øcoffing ≈øtocke to the world, by cunning planting upon his head <hi>Acteons</hi> livery. Thus for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure he gets mi≈øery, and for a beautifull out≈øide embraceth a ≈ønake in his bo≈øome, poy≈øon in his meat, and gall in his drinke. Againe, I would not bee under≈øtood to meane that covetous de≈øire which is al≈øo commonly clothed with this title, and in the≈øe dayes chiefly embraced, when a man doth onely chu≈øe a wife for riches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119685:89"/> hee cannot like her per≈øon, much le≈ø≈øe love her. Such may meet with one that may fulfill his de≈øire with wealth, but commonly ≈øhe proves a ≈øcolding <hi>Xantippe,</hi> one that will be alwayes ≈øcolding, railing, and taunting him, and with whom hee ≈øhall never live one quiet houre. Thus for a little wealth he is alwayes pinched with a ≈øtrait ≈øhooe, lives in continuall vexation, and at the la≈øt is forced to leave her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he cannot live quietly with her. But this is not the love which I purpo≈øe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe, for this is carnall, earthly, and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but the other is naturall, hone≈øt, and commendable, which is an hone≈øt de≈øire of the minde to bee joyned to a woman, not ≈øo much for her outward perfections, as for her inward vertues; not onely for her wealth, but for the love of her per≈øon, ≈øo it goes equally betweene the≈øe two, and exceeds in neither, for it is grounded upon the true cau≈øes for which matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> for the prevention of ≈øinne, for the mutuall ≈øociety, comfort, aide, a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, coun≈øell, and advice of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119685:90"/> di≈øcreet, vertuous, and loving companion, in all exigents; and to bee carefull in the bringing up or education of their children in the feare of God, that they prove not cur≈øes rather then ble≈ø≈øings. I did con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the kindes of love in the metaphor of water, I will now turne the phra≈øe, and write of this in the metaphor of fire. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the pious love which was the fir≈øt, and the charitable love which was the la≈øt, may very well be compared unto wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is of a heavie nature, for it runs very ≈ølowly in the hearts of the children of men, and cannot be drawne out of the fountaine of the heart without great force, and ≈øtrong pumping: the rea≈øon is becau≈øe it doth not ≈øpring there, for it is infu≈øed by the Spirit of God. But<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the other love, which is carnall, earthly, and ≈øinfull, doth flow from thence in great abundance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it naturally ≈øprings there, and may better be compared to fire, which is of a light nature, for wickedne≈ø≈øe burneth as a fire, which will con≈øume both body and ≈øoule, if it be not prevented by repentance.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119685:90"/> So al≈øo this naturall love burneth as a fire in an hone≈øt heart, which is infu≈øed by a divine power, and not by our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt rea≈øon or judgement. Now as fire I will con≈øider it in 4. things: in its ≈ømoke, or manife≈øtation; in its fire, or augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in its flame, or confirmation; and in its a≈øhes, or con≈øummation. Fir≈øt, con≈øider this fire of true love in its ≈ømoke: it is a common proverb, <hi>Where there is ≈ømoke there is fire;</hi> ≈øo where there are apparent manife≈øtations of love, there is love. The ≈øignes of love are the≈øe, in the tongue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull ≈øpeeches; in the eyes, amorous lookes; in the countenance, mode≈øt ba≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe; in the hands, liberall pre≈øents; and in the face, active nimblene≈ø≈øe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the beloved object. But if this love goes no further, then it is ea≈øily quenched with a drop of the water of rejection, or trod out with the foot of di≈ødaine.</p>
                  <p>But in the ≈øecond place, if fuell bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this fire, <hi>viz.</hi> if there be a mutuall and ≈øympathizing affection betweene the lover and his love, then it burnes mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
